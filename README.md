Dice Pig Game

During a JS course we build a simple browser game in JS called Pig Game and its played with dice. The rules are the following:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his Current score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his Current score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his Current score gets added to his GLoBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

Extra rules

- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- Players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.

Also added some statistics and will add a computer mode where the player will be able to play against the computer, predefining the difficulty too.
